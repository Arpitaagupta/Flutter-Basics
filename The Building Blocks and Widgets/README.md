## [1. Text, Images, and Padding](https://github.com/Arpitaagupta/Flutter-Basics/tree/main/The%20Building%20Blocks%20and%20Widgets/text_images_padding)
Text and Images are fundamental widgets used for displaying textual content and images in your Flutter app. Padding is a widget used to add space around other widgets to control the spacing and layout.

## [2. Rows and Columns](https://github.com/Arpitaagupta/Flutter-Basics/tree/main/The%20Building%20Blocks%20and%20Widgets/rows_and_columns)
Rows and Columns are widgets that allow you to arrange other widgets in horizontal (Row) or vertical (Column) sequences. They are commonly used to create flexible layouts for various screen sizes.

## [3. Scaffold and AppBar](https://github.com/Arpitaagupta/Flutter-Basics/tree/main/The%20Building%20Blocks%20and%20Widgets/scaffold_and_appbars)
Scaffold is a basic structure for implementing Material Design layouts in Flutter. AppBar is a widget used as the top app bar that provides navigation and title functionality in the Scaffold.

## [4. Stack](https://github.com/Arpitaagupta/Flutter-Basics/tree/main/The%20Building%20Blocks%20and%20Widgets/stack_example)
Stack is a widget that overlays multiple widgets on top of each other. It allows you to create complex layouts by stacking widgets and controlling their positions in the z-axis.

## [5. ListView and ListTile](https://github.com/Arpitaagupta/Flutter-Basics/tree/main/The%20Building%20Blocks%20and%20Widgets/list_view_and_list_tile)

ListView is a scrollable list of widgets arranged in a linear format, either horizontally or vertically. ListTile is a widget often used within ListView to create a specific type of tile with leading and trailing icons.

## [6. Expanded](https://github.com/Arpitaagupta/Flutter-Basics/tree/main/The%20Building%20Blocks%20and%20Widgets/expanded_example)
The Expanded widget is used to distribute available space within a Row, Column, or Flex widget. It allows you to control how much space a child widget can occupy within the available space.

## [7. Container](https://github.com/Arpitaagupta/Flutter-Basics/tree/main/The%20Building%20Blocks%20and%20Widgets/container_example)
Container is a versatile widget used for styling and positioning other widgets. It allows you to add borders, padding, margins, and background color to the child widgets.

## [8. Card](https://github.com/Arpitaagupta/Flutter-Basics/tree/main/The%20Building%20Blocks%20and%20Widgets/card_example)
Card is a material design-inspired widget used to represent a tile with rounded corners. It's commonly used to display content as individual cards in a list or grid.

## [9. Buttons](https://github.com/Arpitaagupta/Flutter-Basics/tree/main/The%20Building%20Blocks%20and%20Widgets/buttons_example)
Flutter provides various button widgets like RaisedButton, FlatButton, and IconButton to add interactive elements to your app and capture user interactions.

## [10. Assignment](https://github.com/Arpitaagupta/Flutter-Basics/tree/main/The%20Building%20Blocks%20and%20Widgets/assignment_2)
