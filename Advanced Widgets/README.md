This README provides an overview of advanced widgets in Flutter, covering various topics such as Slivers, TabBar, Clippers, Theming, and an Assignment. 

## üîóTable of Contents

## [1. Slivers](https://github.com/Arpitaagupta/Flutter-Basics/blob/main/Advanced%20Widgets/slivers/lib/main.dart)
Slivers are specialized scrollable areas in Flutter that are used to create custom scrolling effects. They allow you to create flexible and dynamic scrolling behaviors, often used in complex UIs like app bars with collapsing headers.

## [2. TabBar](https://github.com/Arpitaagupta/Flutter-Basics/blob/main/Advanced%20Widgets/tab_bar/lib/main.dart)
TabBar is a widget that provides a horizontal, material-style tab bar. It's commonly used to implement tab-based navigation, allowing users to switch between different screens or sections of an app easily.

## [3. Clippers](https://github.com/Arpitaagupta/Flutter-Basics/blob/main/Advanced%20Widgets/clippers/lib/main.dart)
Clippers in Flutter are used to custom shape widgets by clipping them with various shapes. This allows developers to create visually appealing and unique designs that go beyond the usual rectangular or circular boundaries.

## [4. Theming](https://github.com/Arpitaagupta/Flutter-Basics/blob/main/Advanced%20Widgets/theming/lib/main.dart)
Theming in Flutter enables you to apply consistent and customizable styles to your app. With theming, you can easily change the look and feel of your app by defining colors, fonts, and other design elements in a centralized manner.

## [5. Assignment](#advanced-widgets-level-up-your-ui)
The assignment section in this repository provides exercises or tasks related to advanced widgets. These assignments are designed to help you practice and solidify your understanding of the concepts covered in this README.
