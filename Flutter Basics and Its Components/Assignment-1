To upgrade Flutter to the latest version, you can use the Flutter SDK's built-in upgrade command. Here's how you can do it:

Open a terminal or command prompt.

Run the following command to upgrade Flutter:
``` flutter upgrade ```


This command will check for the latest version of Flutter available and update your current Flutter installation to the newest version.

After running the upgrade command, Flutter will download and install the latest version. The process may take a few minutes depending on your internet connection and the size of the update.

Once the upgrade is complete, you should see a message indicating that Flutter has been successfully upgraded to the latest version.

To verify that the upgrade was successful, you can run the following command to check the Flutter version:
``` flutter --version ```
