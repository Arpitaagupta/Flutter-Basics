# ‚≠êFlutter and Its Basic Components

This README provides an introduction to Flutter and covers its fundamental components that are essential for building mobile applications.

## üîóTable of Contents 

## 1. Introduction

Flutter is an open-source UI software development kit created by Google. It allows developers to build natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. Flutter uses the Dart programming language to create beautiful and high-performance user interfaces.

## 2. Installation

To get started with Flutter, you need to install the Flutter SDK and set up the necessary development environment for your operating system. The installation process is well-documented and straightforward, enabling you to begin app development quickly.

## 3. Basic Structure and Creating Flutter Project

Flutter projects follow a specific directory structure. Understanding the basic project structure is crucial for organizing your code efficiently. You can create a new Flutter project using the Flutter command-line tool and start building your app.

## [4. Stateless Widgets](https://github.com/Arpitaagupta/Flutter-Basics/blob/main/Flutter%20Basics%20and%20Its%20Components/stateless_widgets_example/lib/main.dart)

In Flutter, a widget is a basic building block of the user interface. Stateless widgets are immutable and do not change their state during the lifetime of the application. They are used to represent components that don't require dynamic updates.

## [5. Stateful Widgets](https://github.com/Arpitaagupta/Flutter-Basics/blob/main/Flutter%20Basics%20and%20Its%20Components/stateful_widget_example/lib/main.dart)

Stateful widgets, on the other hand, are mutable and can change their state during the app's execution. These widgets are used when the UI needs to reflect changes based on user interactions, data updates, or other events.

## [6. Assets](https://github.com/Arpitaagupta/Flutter-Basics/blob/main/Flutter%20Basics%20and%20Its%20Components/assets_example/lib/main.dart)

Flutter allows you to include and use various assets in your application, such as images, fonts, and other files. You can easily reference these assets in your code, making it convenient to manage and display resources.

## [7. Plugins](https://github.com/Arpitaagupta/Flutter-Basics/blob/main/Flutter%20Basics%20and%20Its%20Components/plugins_example/lib/main.dart)

Flutter provides a rich ecosystem of plugins that extend the functionality of your app. Plugins allow you to access device-specific features, APIs, and third-party services, making it easier to integrate various functionalities into your Flutter app.

## [8. Assignment](https://github.com/Arpitaagupta/Flutter-Basics/blob/main/Flutter%20Basics%20and%20Its%20Components/Assignment-1)

The assignment section in this repository provides exercises and tasks related to Flutter's basic components. These assignments are designed to help you practice and solidify your understanding of fundamental Flutter concepts.
